  ✔ Put tread on new wheels and swap with ebot wheels (Brian?) @done(23-02-27 23:04)
  ☐ Lower poop chute 
  ✔ Double check auton logistics code still breaks on ebot HW; and ifTrue fix  (Chris) @done(23-02-27 23:04)
  ✔ Confirm LED Code on bot (Code looks correct now) (Chris/Caleb) @done(23-02-27 23:05)
  ☐ CAN connection exception check (Jon/Chris)

  ☐ Restore momentary button for switching to RobotCentric

## Mid Priority

  ☐ Handles added to drivestation

  ☐ Fault Accommodation for software (what happens if a line break fails or encoder does our code “fail gracefully” and are there manual backups)
  ☐ Check limelight data and ensure it doesn’t cause a runtime error if unplugged
  ✔ Leds add ground cube state @done(23-02-27 23:06)
  ☐ Print 3 more LL covers (Chris)

## Low Priority
